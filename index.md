## Welcome to Dale Koenig's GitHub

I am a mathematician currently residing in Japan.  I am looking to move to industry to work on data science and machine learning.  I have begun work on the projects here rather recently, but hope to expand the list with time and as my skills improve.


## [Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/DaleKoenig/BasicNST) 

A script to apply neural style transfer written using tensorflow and keras.

## [Maze3D](https://github.com/DaleKoenig/Maze3D)
